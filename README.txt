This script is a simple maze solver

Assumptions:
1- The maze is only black and white, black is a wall and white is a path
2- The start is at the top, and the end is at the bottom 
3- The maze is a square

TODO:
1- Implement breadth-first, A*...etc
2- Make the solution gradient not just red
3- Optimise and refactor

Notes:
- This script is far from being ideal or optimal, it's just a fun project I wanted to try
-
